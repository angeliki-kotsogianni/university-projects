These are some of the projects I have done so far during my studies(Informatics Department, Athens University of Economics and Business). 
The Python project is a diary.
The HTML project is a website. 
The C++ game needs the sgg library to run and is based on the game "Geometry Dash".
The C project is implementing a simulator of a pizza store using threads and mutexes.
Others include data structures in Java and some code in Assembly.
More to come.
